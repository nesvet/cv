## Hi 👋

I build complex product systems: from architecture and code to deployment and operations.

For the past 10 years, I built **Roadmap** — an enterprise investment project management system (Electron + web/on‑prem).

## What I do

I design architecture, write code, and set up infrastructure for TypeScript web and desktop applications — from protocols and data models to UI, deployment, and support.

**Core stack:**
- TypeScript, React, Node.js / Bun
- Electron, Pixi.js (WebGL)
- MongoDB, Docker
- WebSocket, pub/sub

**What I built in Roadmap:**
- A full‑stack real‑time framework: MongoDB Change Streams → WebSocket pub/sub, RPC, streaming
- Users, organizations, roles, and access control; end‑to‑end reactivity from the database to the UI
- Electron client: multi‑window, window synchronization, undo/redo, collaboration, i18n
- Interactive visualizations: Gantt chart and network graph (WebGL/SVG/HTML layers), zooming and filtering
- HTTP API, document upload and storage (GridFS)
- On‑prem operations: Docker Compose, nginx, ACME/Let’s Encrypt, database backups with retention
- esbuild-based build pipeline and desktop releases for multiple platforms (GitHub Actions matrix)
- Monorepo: ~30 npm packages, workspaces (Bun)

Over the last year and a half, I’ve been leading a team of 5 developers: code reviews, architectural decisions, mentoring.

## Tools

I actively use AI-assisted development.

ESLint for consistency and code quality control.

In new projects, I’ve switched to Bun.

## Now

I’m interested in Senior/Lead Engineer roles in product teams or a Founding Engineer role for end‑to‑end development.

I prefer remote, but I’m open to discussion.
